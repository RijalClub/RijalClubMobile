## Introduction

Welcome to the RijalClub Mobile App repository. By scanning the QR code above with the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app, you can instantly preview the latest preview of the application on your device. No installation or setup required other than downloading expo go from your respective app store!

[IOS app store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/expo-go/id982107779)
[Android playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)

## Getting Started for Beginners

### Prerequisites

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): A JavaScript runtime required to run Expo and React Native projects.
2. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/): A fast, reliable, and secure dependency manager.
3. [Expo CLI](https://expo.dev/tools#cli): A command line tool to develop and build Expo apps.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RijalClub/RijalClubMobile.git
    cd RijalClubMobile
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    yarn
    ```

3. **Start the Development Server**:
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

    This will open a new tab in your default browser with a QR code. Scan this code with the Expo Go app on your device to see the app in action!

## For Advanced Users

If you're familiar with React Native and Expo, you can dive straight into the code. Just ensure you've updated your dependencies using `yarn` before starting the development server.

## Troubleshooting
(local development only)
- **QR code not working?** 
    - Ensure you're connected to the same network on both your development machine and your mobile device.
    - If you're still facing issues, please refer to the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/) or reach out to our developer team.

- **Facing package issues or errors?** 
    - Ensure you've installed all the dependencies using `yarn install`.
    - If problems persist, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and `yarn.lock` file, then run `yarn install` again.
